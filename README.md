## About blog posts

Everyone in the community is encouraged to post blogs on MicroProfile.io. The process to submit a post is described below.

NOTE: If this is the first time you're submitting a blog or setting up a post on MicroProfile.io to redirect to an existing blog, please send an email to microprofile-marketing@googlegroups.com requesting to be added to the site as a “contributor”.

What is a WP-Contributor:

* Contributor: is somebody who can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them

### Case 1: You plan to write and host your post on the MicroProfile.io site, i.e. blog post is NOT a redirect to another existing blog URL

1. Log in to the WordPress [console](https://microprofile.wpengine.com/wp-admin/) and enter your WordPress credentials (these were in an email you received when you were added to MicroProfile.io as a "contributor")

2. On the left margin of the console, click on "Posts->Add New"

3. Write your new blog using the WordPress user interface

4. Choose a category and enter tags on the right side of the screen in the “tags” box. (These are keywords related to the topic of your post).

5. Scroll down to the "Feature Image" widget and upload an image by clicking on the "Set feature image" link. The image should be between 1600px - 2000px wide and have a minimum height of 500px for best results.  

6. When done entering your blog post, click on the “Submit for Review” button. This will effectively put the blog post on the WP blog inbox for all WP admins. As a writer, you are done at this point.

7. Available Admins review your blog and approval to post by reviewer or a peer admin is contengeant on "suggestive edits".  If your post needs copy/editing, you will receive a notification so that you can edit your post with the necessary corrections and re-submit.

3. In the "Enter title here" text field of the screen "Add New Post", copy and paste the title of the existing post

5. Paste the first three lines of your blog post right below the URL you pasted in the previous step.

6. On the right side of the screen, select a category and add tags to the post. Tags are keywords related to the topic of your article.

7. Scroll down to the "Feature Image" widget and upload an image by clicking on the "Set feature image" link. The image should be between 1600px - 2000px wide and have a minimum height of 500px for best results.
