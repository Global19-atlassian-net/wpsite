# MicroProfile.io WordPress site

The https://MicroProfile.io site has been revamped to the WordPress (WP) platform for easier use and maintenance. To provide feedback on how to improve the new site, please use the GitHub issues tab above to enter your requests/suggestions.

## About blog posts

Everyone in the community is encouraged to post blogs on MicroProfile.io. The process to submit a post is described below.

NOTE: If this is the first time you're submitting a blog, please send an email to microprofile-marketing@googlegroups.com requesting to be added to site as a “contributor”.

### Case 1: You plan to write and host your post on the MicroProfile.io site, i.e. blog post is NOT a redirect to another existing blog URL

1. Log in to the WP [console](https://microprofile.wpengine.com/wp-admin/) and enter your WP credentials (these were in an email you received when you were added to MicroProfile.io as a "contributor")

2. On the left margin of the console, click on "Posts->Add New"

3. Write your new blog using the Word Press user interface

4. When done entering your blog post, click on the “Submit for Review” button. This will effectively put the blog post on the WP blog inbox for all WP admins. As a writer, you are done at this point.

5. An admin reviews the blog post and then approves for immediate or future scheduling.  This will push post “live”. If your post needs re-working, you will receive a notification so that you can edit your post with the necessary corrections and re-submit. 

#### Criteria for approving blog posts

The following are some of the criteria that an admin will use when reviewing your submitted blog post:

* Check that post has a “Page Header Image”

* The image should be between 1600px - 2000px wide and have a minimum height of 500px for best results. If you need help resizing image, please send to [Ryan](rstjames@tomitribe.com) for styling

* Check for grammatical errors - admin can fix this

* Check for TMs and copyrights - admin can fix this or send back to author to fix

* Ensure content of post is relevant and applicable to Microprofile
